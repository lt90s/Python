# Pythonic Thinking

## Item 10: Prefer enumerate Over range
Instead of

```python
value = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
for idx in range(len(value)):
    print "%d: %d" %(idx + 1, value[idx])
```

Using

```python
value = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
for idx, val in enumerate(value):
    print "%d: %d" %(idx + 1, val)
```

Or

```python
value = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
for idx, val in enumerate(value, 1):
    print "%d: %d" %(idx, val)
```

## Item 11: Use zip to Process Iterators in Parallel

```python
names = ['Cecilia', 'Lise', 'Marie']
letters = [len(n) for n in names]
```

Find out the longest name

```python
longest_name = None
max_letters = 0
for i, name in enumerate(names):
    count = letters[i]
    if count > max_letters:
        longest_name = name
        max_letters = count
print(longest_name)
```

Prefer using

```python
longest_name = None
max_letters = 0
for name, count in zip(names, letters):
    if count > max_letters:
        longest_name = name
        max_letters = count
print(longest_name)
```

***Things to Remember***:

1. The zip built-in function can be used to iterate over multiple iterators in parallel.
2. In Python 3, zip is a lazy generator that produces tuples. In Python 2, zip returns
the full result as a list of tuples.
3. zip truncates its output silently if you supply it with iterators of different lengths.

## Item 12: Avoid else Blocks After for and while Loops

1. The else block after a loop only runs if the loop body did not encounter a break
statement.
2. Avoid using else blocks after loops because their behavior isnâ€™t intuitive and can
be confusing.

## Item 13: Take Advantage of Each Block in try/except/else/finally

1. The try/finally compound statement lets you run cleanup code regardless of
whether exceptions were raised in the try block.
2. The else block helps you minimize the amount of code in try blocks and visually
distinguish the success case from the try/except blocks.
3. An else block can be used to perform additional actions after a successful try
block but before common cleanup in a finally block.
